# Algorithms Techniques & Data Structures

This project wants to reflect different algorithm implementations and the creation of data structures to solve various problems.
####
The exercises have been divided mainly into three sections: Fundamentals of Algorithms, Data structures and Advance algorithmic techniques.

## Documentation

### Fundamentals of Algorithms
 - Analyzing the efficiency of algorithms
 - Design and analysis of iterative algorithms
 - Design and analysis of recursive algorithms
 - Divide and conquer algorithms
 - Backtracking algorithms

### Data structures
 - Linear data types
 - Tree-like data types
 - Dictionaries
 - Applications of abstract data types

### Advance algorithmic techniques
 - Advanced search trees
 - Priority queues and heaps
 - Graphs
 - Disjoint sets
 - Amortized analysis
 - Greedy algorithms
 - Dynamic programming
 
 ## Implementation
 The implementation of the algorithms and data structures was carried out using C ++
